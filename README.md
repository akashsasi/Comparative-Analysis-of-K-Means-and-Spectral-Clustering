# Comparative-Analysis-of-K-Means-and-Spectral-Clustering
In computer vision, image segmentation is an essential task with applications ranging from object recognition to medical imaging. This project offers a thorough comparison of K-Means and Spectral Clustering[2], two popular clustering methods for image segmentation. The main goal is to assess how well these algorithms perform in terms of robustness, computational efficiency, and segmentation accuracy across various image datasets.

The research uses a methodical experimental design, benchmarking the segmentation outcomes against standard image datasets. Evaluations that are both qualitative and quantitative are carried out, taking into account metrics like V-Measure. Furthermore, in order to shed light on the effectiveness of K-Means and Spectral Clustering for large-scale image datasets, their computational complexity and runtime performance are examined.

The outcomes of this project clearly demonstrate that the spectral clustering is generally more effective than K-means, especially when there is non-linear separability in the data. The algorithm's performance is not always better, as problems can occur when using datasets such as "Blobs with varied variances" and "Anisotropic data."
